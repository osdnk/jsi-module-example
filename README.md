Example of building JSI module from scratch with Fresh react-native project


This module is a very simple minimal example of how JSI modules can be built with minimal effort.
I expect that most of the code for any new module can be mostly copied from this source. 

This work was  inspired by

1. (react-native-multithreading)[https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-multithreading]. This is quite a nice example.
However, the redundant complexity comes from creating new threads what is not needed in this basic example.

2. (react-native-reanimated). Similarly, this library is doing a lot of things.

I skipped the building and publishing process which is also not trivial and will be important while releasing the library to npm (as .so file)
